## Abstract
There is some fixed-pattern noise in the OCR text image and the denosing is needed to improve recognition accuracy. This paper proposes a convolution-based approach for fixed-pattern noise removal in OCR. The approach identifies the location of text content pixels and removes noise pixels based on the convolution kernel. The experiment shows that the approach is an effective way to remove the underline and improve recognition accuracy. For its generality, the algorithm is also applicable to removing another type of fixed-pattern noise.
