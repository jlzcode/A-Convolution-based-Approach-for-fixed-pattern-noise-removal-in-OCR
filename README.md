# A-Convolution-based-Approach-for-fixed-pattern-noise-removal-in-OCR
* Abstract *
There is some fixed-pattern noise in the OCR text 
image and the denosing is needed to improve the accuracy of 
recognition. In this paper, a convolution-based approach for 
the fixed-pattern noise removal in OCR is proposed. The 
approach identifies the location of text content pixels and 
removes noise pixels based on the convolution kernel. The 
experiment shows that the approach is an effective way to 
remove the underline and improve the accuracy of recognition. 
For its generality, the algorithm is also applicable of removing 
other type of fixed-pattern noise.
